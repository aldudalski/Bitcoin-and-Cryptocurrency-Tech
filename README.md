# Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Tech

Here are a set of solutions I developed to the the Coursera Princeton Bitcoin and Cryptcurrency course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency)

I've included surrounding starter code that was provided and included unit tests that helped test algorithm effectiveness.

The actual assignment deliverables were as follows:

## Assignment 1 deliverables

* MaxFeeTxHandler.java
* TxHandler.java

## Assignment 2 deliverables

* CompliantNode.java

## Assignment 3 deliverables

* BlockChain.java
