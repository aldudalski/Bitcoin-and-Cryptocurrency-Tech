# Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Tech

This is the Coursera Princeton Bitcoin and Cryptcurrency course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency)

These are the solutions I developed that may be useful to other students.

I've included surrounding starter code that was provided and included unit tests that helped debug the code in the repository.

The actual assignment deliverables were as follows:

## Assignment 1 deliverables

* MaxFeeTxHandler.java
* TxHandler.java

## Assignment 2 deliverables

## Assignment 3 deliverables

* BlockChain.java
